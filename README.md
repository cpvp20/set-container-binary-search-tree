# set-container-binary-search-tree


Wrote a program that implements the Set container, separating the definition (Set.h) from the implementation (Set.c) and the use (.c).
Wrote a main function where I use the container to prove that all its functions work correctly. Lastly, print the tree pre-order and destroy the Set.
